Stash replaced with Phpfastcache
--------------------------------

The internal caching library Stash has been replaced with `Phpfastcache <https://www.phpfastcache.com/>`_. 
Phpfastcache is better maintained, provides more cachedrivers and adds more features to the cache implementation. 
This change should cause no issues on any existing installation. 
If you have Memcache or Redis configured in your `elgg-config/settings.php` you might need to update your configuration.

Metadata and Annotation boolean values
--------------------------------------

The database model has been changed to keep boolean values intact between saving and retrieving. 
Before this change if you saved a boolean value it would be returned as an integer. Now it will remain a boolean. 

.. warning::

	If you saved boolean values previously they will still be integers in the database (until saved again).

Javascript functions
--------------------

The Elgg javascript libraries have gotten a massive overhaul. A lot of functions have been deprecated. 
You can find all deprecated functions and globals in `views/default/core/js/deprecated.js`.

Security
--------

``output/url`` now has added security features to help prevent malicious user generated output. 
The view supports ``$vars['allowed_schemes']`` which contains a list of allowed URL schemes. The provided ``$vars['href']`` will be
matched against the allowed list. If the URL doesn't have an allowed scheme the URL will be prefixed with ``denied:``.

This will help to prevent user input like ``javascript:alert('just testing');`` from being presented to the users.

By default the following schemes are allowed: ``http, https, ftp, sftp, ssh, file``

If you use the pattern ``elgg_view('output/url', ['text' => 'something', 'href' => 'javascript:void(0);'])`` update your code to set
``href`` to ``false``.

Deprecated APIs
---------------

 * ``elgg_view_menu_item()`` use ``elgg_view('navigation/menu/elements/item/url', ['item' => $myMenuItem])``
