PHP Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimal PHP version is now 8.1.

Annotations
-----------

Due to a naming conflict in the default join alias between the ``annotations`` and ``metadata`` table, the default join
alias for the ``annotations`` table has been changed from ``n_table`` to ``a_table``.

If your code uses very specific clauses (select, where, order_by, etc.) you need to update your code. If you use the
``\Elgg\Database\QueryBuilder`` for your query parts you should be ok.
