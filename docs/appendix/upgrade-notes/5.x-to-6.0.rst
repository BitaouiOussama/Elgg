Databases
---------

DB Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - The minimal MySQL version is now 8.0
 - The minimal MariaDB version is now 10.6


Composer
--------

PHP Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimal PHP version is now 8.1. Also the ``intl`` module is now required to be enabled.

PHPUnit
~~~~~~~

Elgg now uses PHPUnit 10.5. You might need to update your tests.

Annotations
-----------

Due to a naming conflict in the default join alias between the ``annotations`` and ``metadata`` table, the default join
alias for the ``annotations`` table has been changed from ``n_table`` to ``a_table``.

If your code uses very specific clauses (select, where, order_by, etc.) you need to update your code. If you use the
``\Elgg\Database\QueryBuilder`` for your query parts you should be ok.

Changes in functions
--------------------

Lib functions function parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``elgg_get_simplecache_url()`` has the second argument (``$subview``) removed. The full ``$view`` name needs to be provided as the first argument.

Miscellaneous API changes
-------------------------

* The interface ``\Elgg\EntityIcon`` has been removed. Implemented functions in ``\ElggEntity`` have been moved to ``\Elgg\Traits\Entity\Icons``

Removed Config values
------------------------

* ``system_cache_loaded``
